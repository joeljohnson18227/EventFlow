##  What is EventFlow?

**EventFlow** is an open-source, modular web platform that provides complete digital infrastructure to run hackathons, open-source programs, and community tech events.

It replaces scattered tools like **Google Forms, Sheets, emails, and chats** with **one unified system**.

---

## Problem Statement

Most tech events rely on:

- Disconnected tools  
- Manual tracking  
- Error-prone spreadsheets  
- No reusable infrastructure  

This results in confusion, inconsistent evaluation, and a poor participant experience.

EventFlow addresses these challenges by providing a reusable, modular event infrastructure engine.

## Architecture

```
├── app/
│   ├── (auth)/          # Authentication routes (Login, Register)
│   ├── (dashboard)/     # Role-based dashboards (Admin, Participant, Judge)
│   ├── api/             # Backend API routes
│   └── layout.js        # Root layout & providers
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
├── models/              # Mongoose database models
├── lib/                 # Utility functions & DB connection
└── public/              # Static assets
```

Built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MongoDB**. The project uses a modular folder structure to separate concerns between auth, dashboards, and API logic.
The app directory follows the Next.js 14 App Router architecture.

The models directory contains Mongoose schemas defining database structure.

Modular, role-based, and reusable by design.

Utility functions, database connection logic, and shared helpers
